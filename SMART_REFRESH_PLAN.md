# 🚀 Smart Activity-Based Refresh - Implementation Plan

## 📋 **PR Breakdown (TDD Approach)**

### **PR #1: Foundation - Activity Detection Hook** 
*Base: master | Target: feature/activity-refresh-foundation*

**🎯 Goal:** Establish core activity monitoring with comprehensive test coverage

**📁 Files Added:**
- `src/hooks/useActivityRefresh.ts`
- `src/hooks/useActivityRefresh.test.ts`
- `src/types/ActivityTypes.ts`

**🧪 TDD Step 1 - Write Failing Tests:**
```markdown
useActivityRefresh.test.ts:
✅ 'should initialize with default inactivity threshold' - verifies 5min default
✅ 'should detect user activity events properly' - mouse, keyboard, touch
✅ 'should trigger callback after inactivity period' - timer functionality  
✅ 'should debounce rapid successive activity events' - performance optimization
✅ 'should cleanup all listeners on unmount' - memory leak prevention
✅ 'should not trigger callback when disabled' - conditional logic
✅ 'should reset timer on new activity' - timer reset behavior
✅ 'should handle invalid threshold values gracefully' - edge cases
```

**🔧 TDD Step 2 - Minimal Implementation:**
- `useActivityRefresh(callback, threshold, enabled)` hook
- Activity event listeners (mousemove, keydown, touchstart)
- Debounced inactivity timer
- Cleanup logic

**✅ Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All tests pass (8/8)
- [ ] Hook handles edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Zero memory leaks in cleanup
- [ ] TypeScript types fully defined

### **PR #2: Page Visibility Integration**
*Base: feature/activity-refresh-foundation | Target: feature/visibility-refresh*

**🎯 Goal:** Add intelligent tab visibility-based refresh

**📁 Files Added:**
- `src/hooks/useVisibilityRefresh.ts` 
- `src/hooks/useVisibilityRefresh.test.ts`
- `src/utils/visibilityHelpers.ts`

**🧪 TDD Step 1 - Write Failing Tests:**
```markdown
useVisibilityRefresh.test.ts:
✅ 'should refresh when tab becomes visible after threshold' - visibility trigger
✅ 'should respect minimum refresh interval limits' - anti-spam protection  
✅ 'should skip refresh if data recently updated' - intelligent skipping
✅ 'should handle Page Visibility API unavailability' - browser compatibility
✅ 'should not refresh immediately on quick tab switches' - UX optimization
✅ 'should track visibility state changes accurately' - state management
✅ 'should cleanup visibility listeners properly' - resource management
```

**🔧 TDD Step 2 - Minimal Implementation:**
- `useVisibilityRefresh(callback, minInterval)` hook
- Page Visibility API integration with fallbacks
- Intelligent refresh timing logic
- Cross-browser compatibility layer

**✅ Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] All tests pass (7/7)
- [ ] Works across major browsers
- [ ] Graceful API fallback
- [ ] No refresh spam protection

### **PR #3: Smart Adaptive Polling**
*Base: feature/visibility-refresh | Target: feature/smart-polling*

**🎯 Goal:** Implement intelligent background polling with activity awareness

**📁 Files Added:**
- `src/hooks/useSmartPolling.ts`
- `src/hooks/useSmartPolling.test.ts`
- `src/utils/pollingStrategies.ts`

**🧪 TDD Step 1 - Write Failing Tests:**
```markdown
useSmartPolling.test.ts:
✅ 'should poll faster when user is active' - adaptive intervals  
✅ 'should stop polling when tab becomes hidden' - performance optimization
✅ 'should use exponential backoff on consecutive errors' - error resilience
✅ 'should resume normal polling after successful recovery' - recovery logic
✅ 'should respect maximum and minimum poll intervals' - boundary conditions
✅ 'should cleanup polling on unmount' - resource cleanup
✅ 'should handle rapid enable/disable toggles' - state management
✅ 'should integrate with activity detection seamlessly' - hook composition
```

**🔧 TDD Step 2 - Minimal Implementation:**
- `useSmartPolling(callback, strategy, enabled)` hook  
- Adaptive polling intervals (active: 30s, idle: 2min)
- Exponential backoff error handling
- Integration with useActivityRefresh

**✅ Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All tests pass (8/8)  
- [ ] CPU-efficient background operation
- [ ] Proper error recovery behavior
- [ ] Smooth activity integration

### **PR #4: TaskFocusedView UI Integration**
*Base: feature/smart-polling | Target: feature/refresh-ui*

**🎯 Goal:** Integrate smart refresh into main UI with visual feedback

**📁 Files Modified:**
- `src/components/TaskFocusedView.tsx`
- `src/components/TaskFocusedView.refresh.test.tsx` (new test file)
- `src/hooks/useAirtable.ts`

**🧪 TDD Step 1 - Write Failing Tests:**
```markdown
TaskFocusedView.refresh.test.tsx:
✅ 'should display refresh button with last update timestamp' - UI elements
✅ 'should show loading spinner during manual refresh' - loading states  
✅ 'should update timestamp after successful data refresh' - timestamp sync
✅ 'should handle manual refresh errors with user feedback' - error UX
✅ 'should integrate activity refresh with existing real-time' - compatibility
✅ 'should disable refresh button during ongoing operations' - UX protection
✅ 'should show activity indicator when auto-refresh triggers' - user awareness
✅ 'should maintain refresh state across component re-renders' - persistence
```

**🔧 TDD Step 2 - Minimal Implementation:**
- Manual refresh button with loading states
- "Ostatnia aktualizacja: X minut temu" timestamp
- Integration with all 3 smart refresh hooks
- Error handling with user notifications
- Compatibility with existing real-time system

**✅ Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All tests pass (8/8)
- [ ] Seamless UX during refresh operations  
- [ ] No conflicts with existing real-time
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for users

- `src/hooks/useSmartRefresh.ts` - unified hook wrapper
- `src/hooks/useSmartRefresh.test.ts` - integration tests
- Updates to `CLAUDE.md` with new patterns

**🧪 TDD Step 1 - Write Integration Tests:**
```markdown  
useSmartRefresh.test.ts:
✅ 'should coordinate all refresh strategies harmoniously' - integration test
✅ 'should handle concurrent refresh triggers intelligently' - race conditions
✅ 'should maintain performance under heavy usage patterns' - stress testing
✅ 'should preserve user data during refresh operations' - data integrity
